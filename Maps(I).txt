MAP(I):

# MAP interface is an independent interface.
# Combination of keys and values are map or map is a collection of entries.
# Map is an interface, which is implemented by hashmap and hashtble class.

# When we have more number of search operations, then we can go for hashmap.

HahMap:

* Undrelying data structure is Hashtable.
* It does not follow insertion order
* Duplicate keys are not allowed
* Duplicate values can be allowed
* null key allowed only once
* null values can be stored multiple times

Methods:

1) put(k,v) = for inserting
2) putAll(c) = for inserting group of elements

3) get(k) = for retrieving, it will return value based on the key
4) remove(k) = for deleting, it will remove entire record

5) contains(k) = it will return true or false. it will only search for key.
6) contains(v) =  it will return true or false. it will only search for value.

7) isEmty()
8)size()

9)clear() = it will clear all entries



1) m.keySet() = it will return all keys from the hashmap.
2) m.values() = it will return all values from the hashmap
3) m.entrySet() = it will return each entry(pair) from the hashmap. 

Entry interface:

# it ia a subset of hashmap class.

methods in entry interface:

1) e.getkey()
2) e.getvalue()
3) e.setvalue()
